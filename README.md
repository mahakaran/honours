## Project Abstract

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are held together by highly connected multi-specific hub proteins which regulate the function of the substrate proteins that interact with them. Whilst effort has been expended in modelling the evolution of PPI networks from a graph-theoretic, mathematical perspective, relatively little work has investigated the molecular underpinnings of how multi-specific hub proteins recognise their substrates, and how this recognition evolves. Here, we use ancestral sequence reconstruction, coupled with functional assays, macromolecular crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations to (1) address the role of conformational flexibility in the ability of a hub protein, sirtuin-1, to recognise its substrate set; and (2) to delineate changes in the substrate specificity of sirtuin-1 across a reconstructed evolutionary trajectory and correlate these with changes in structure and conformational dynamism. Through this investigation, we hope to show that conformational dynamism in the substrate recognition site of sirtuin-1 permits it to recognise unique substrates at a single site, and that over the course of evolution, particular conformational sub-states are enriched so as to better complement recognition of particular substrates. The outcomes of this study may have important implications for our understanding of how hub proteins recognise multiple substrates, and how changes in hub proteins permit the evolution and expansion of PPI networks.
