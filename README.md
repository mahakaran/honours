# Honours Project: Molecular Evolution of Multi-Specificity in the Sirtuin-1 Family of Proteins
Contains all scripts, notebooks and more that were used in my 2018-2019 Honours year at the Research School of Chemistry, ANU.  

## Subdirectories
1) Phylogenetics. Contains scripts/modules written to perform phylogenetic analyses in this project. Consists of a module that can pull desired information (i.e. maximum-likelihood sequences, posterior probability distributions for all nodes of interest) from the rst file output of PAML (Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum-Likelihood). 

2) MolecularDynamics. As above, but for the MD part of the project. Contains a GROAMCS-compatible workaraound for RIP-MD. 

3) BiochemicalCharacterisation. As above, but for the biochemical part of the project. Contains a module for automated Michaelis-Menten data analysis and detailed data reporting, including outputing PDFs of initial traces and linear fits (used to obtain initial rate) that were used to generate the final Michaelis Menten plot and MM fitting.
