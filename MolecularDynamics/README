# GROMACS-Compatible RIP-MD 
This subdirectory contains a GROMACS-compatible version of RIP-MD that was created in this project by tweaking the RIP-MD source code.
The only files that were altered were main.py and lib/extractFrames.py. To use the GROMACS compatible version of RIP-MD, download RIP-MD
normally from the developers and install as per their directions. Then, copy main.py from this repo into the main RIP-MD 
directory (i.e. replace the main.py that came with the installation, probably rename it so you can still use the normal version) 
and also copy extractFrames.py into the lib directory of your RIP-MD installation (i.e. replace the extractFrames.py that
came with the installation). That should allow you to use RIP-MD with GROMACS.
